//Math Extras Scratch Extension 1.1

//Description

//The Math Extras Scratch Extension adds additional mathematical functionalities to Scratch projects. It includes blocks for various mathematical operations such as checking for integers and decimals, calculating cube roots and powers, determining if a number is in the Fibonacci sequence, checking if a number is odd, prime, or even, providing constants like infinity and Ï€, computing averages, factorials, greatest common divisors (GCD), least common multiples (LCM), reversing numbers, checking for Armstrong numbers, generating Fibonacci series, identifying perfect numbers, calculating the sum of primes, determining amicable pairs, counting divisors, checking for abundant numbers, and finding the nth prime number.

//Usage

//Download the file.
Open Turbowarp.
Go to the "Extensions" section.
Click on "Add Extension" and choose "Custom Extension".
Select the extension file.
Now, you can use the Math Extras blocks in your Scratch projects.

Blocks

The Math Extras extension provides the following blocks:

Old Blocks

Reverse digits of [number]

[number] is an Armstrong number?

Fibonacci series up to [limit]

[number] is a perfect number?

Sum of primes up to [limit]

[number1] and [number2] are an amicable pair?

Number of divisors of [number]

[number] is an abundant number?

Nth prime number [index]

//Examples
//Check if a number is an integer:

scratch
Copy code
When green flag clicked
forever
    if <Is (10) an integer?> then
        say [Yes] for (2) secs
    else
        say [No] for (2) secs
Calculate the factorial of a number:

scratch
Copy code
When green flag clicked
set [result v] to [Factorial of (5)]
Generate Fibonacci series:

scratch
Copy code
When green flag clicked
set [series v] to [Fibonacci series up to (10)]
